# AirdropNftSolidity
Training on ERC721, Upgradeable smart contract etc ...

## Constraints for this project

 1) I have to airdop 100 NFTs : not more than 100
 2) The smart contract must be upgradeable
 3) Gas fees must be paid by the one who is airdropped 
 4) We don't know the future owners of the NFT but they have to claim their NFT on a web page. 
    So that is not possible to mint a NFT elsewhere
